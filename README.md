# yogi css

## WELCOME!

yogi css is another approach to styling websites. Unlike utility or micro frameworks it merely uses attributes to style the DOM.  

### **yogi is classless**

yogi css does not use any classes or ids to style elements. To style an element you simply put an attribute onto it.

> For example:
```html
<!-- put any attribute on any html tag -->
<div main-color padding margin-y border>CONTENT</div>
```

### **why no class or id styling?**

I do very much agree on that. classes and ids are still useful to query dom nodes from js, but other than that we have better tools for styling in 2022.
